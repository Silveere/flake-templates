# flake-templates
This is a personal Nix flake template repository. It serves as an extension to
[NixOS/templates](https://github.com/NixOS/templates). All of the custom
templates in this repository are equipped with
[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) devShells, to make
getting started on projects much easier. Existing upstream templates are passed through unmodified.
